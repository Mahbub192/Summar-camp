- Homepage:

The homepage features a prominent banner section showcasing the "Popular Classes" and "Popular Instructors." In the "Popular Classes" section, the six classes with the highest number of students are displayed. Similarly, the "Popular Instructors" section highlights the six instructors who have the most students. Additionally, a yoga-related YouTube video has been integrated to provide engaging and relevant content.
Classes Page:

The classes page exhibits all the classes that have been approved by the administrator. Upon selecting a class, if a student is not logged in, they will be redirected to the login page. After logging in, students can schedule their desired class. It is important to note that if the administrator or instructor logs in, the class selection button will be disabled to prevent unauthorized changes. Moreover, if a class has zero available seats, its class card background color will be highlighted in red, and the selection button will be disabled accordingly.

- Student Dashboard:

The student dashboard offers students a comprehensive view of their enrolled classes and related information. It provides details on the number of classes the student has attended and enables separate bill payments for each class. Additionally, students can conveniently access their enrolled classes, facilitating easy navigation and management of their schedule.

- Instructor Dashboard:

The instructor dashboard empowers instructors with valuable insights and essential functionalities. Instructors can track the number of students enrolled in their classes, ensuring they stay informed about class participation. The dashboard also displays the status of each class, indicating whether it has been approved or denied. In the case of denial, instructors have access to the feedback provided by the administrator, enabling them to make necessary adjustments or improvements.

- Administrator Capabilities:

The administrator holds pivotal control over the system, with a range of powerful functionalities at their disposal. They possess the ability to elevate any user to the administrator role, granting additional privileges and responsibilities. Furthermore, administrators can deny approval for an instructor's class submission. Instructors, in turn, have the opportunity to provide feedback to the administrator regarding their class. The administrator can also monitor and assess the number of class errors and track the user base utilizing the system.

- Technologies Used:

The development of the platform is built on a robust technology stack comprising HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUi, React, MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, JWT token, Firebase, React Hook Form, Axios, TanStack Query, Stripe, React Icon, Lottiefiles, and React Awesome Reveal. These cutting-edge technologies and libraries contribute to a seamless and efficient user experience while ensuring the platform's scalability and security.
